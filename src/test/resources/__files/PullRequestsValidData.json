The idea is that any reqest to an api endpoint will return some mappingclass which can be mapped to a list of domain objects. The generic function I created takes in this function, the initial response entity and then follows the pagination as far as it can and collects all the responses into one big list of domain objects.\r\n\r\nConsider that this pagination functionality will have to be reworked once #112 is beeing implemented as this functionality will follow the pagination blindly until the end.",
